### Backend
	- Implemented using NestJS
	- Authentication I used Auth0
	- Database I used A NoSQL (MongoDB on Atlas) database due to the nature of the application, additionally I can deploy freely on cloud for demostration.

### Frontend
	- Implemented using React with vite to build and serve.
	- Used ReactQuery and React Hooks for data fetching and state management.
	- Used TailwindCSS+Tremor for styling.
